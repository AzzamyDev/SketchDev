This theme is something I enjoy and hope you do to.

If you get unexpected behavior post an issue and try to keep it as minimal as possible. Ideally bug reports would be reproducible using the QuickStart tutorial plus whatever changes cause the problem.

Pull requests are literally the best thing since ever, so if you have the idea (and the time) to add something to min_night do it! I promise I will respond quickly.

Happy blogging!
