The theme supports syntax highlighting thanks to highlight.js, which is turned on by default. Checkout out the available palette options here. Note highlightStyle param should be hyphen-separated lowercase.

Make sure your main languages render well and keep control on the languages that get special highlighted.

For best aesthetics with dark-mode, I reccommend choosing a light background style that matches your accent color.ww
